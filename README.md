Individual IT project made during my training at the ENSC.
This project tackle the issue of Optimal Camera Placement for Motion Capture Systems in the Presence of 
Dynamic Occlusion. 
The aim is to implement an algorithm described in the article below,
Rahimian, P., & Kearney, J. K. (2015, November). Optimal camera placement for motion capture systems in the presence of dynamic occlusion. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology.
You will find different files wich contains tests, functions and the algorithm of Quality metric. 
I defines functions of triangulation in Qualitymetric.py and the algorithm with a test environment in Model.py, 
CameraInSpace contains different tests and modelisation of cameras, its my training file.      
Hope you enjoy !
